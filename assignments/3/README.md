# JASMINE OH FINAL PROJECT - BEYOND THE DIGITAL

## CONCEPT
Our digital and physical lives are increasingly becoming converged. Sometimes, we rely more on data of our biological health gathered via smart bands and phones to understand our bodies than to believe in our own feelings and intuitions. As our presence in the digital world become more and more prominent, how do our ethical, social, and philosophical values transfer digitally? What are the rules and social habits that are formed online differently from offline? When our possessions in the digital realm live beyond our physical lives, how does that change our behavior towards life and death? "Beyond the Digital" is an initiative to design for a safe and productive future where digital experiences coaleasce with physical ones. This website is meant to prompt questions about digital legacy, identity, and privacy.
